# Hello 👋, My Name is Timothy Eakin

 I am very creative and resourceful. I love drawing, painting, digital art, writing lyrics, dancing, DIY repairs from home improvement to mobile devices and PCs, and creative problem-solving. I have always had a love of learning how things work and especially computers and technology so I decided to become a Data Scientist where I could blend my interests into a fulfilling career. I started programming in high school with Pascal but wrote my first Basic program (out of a book) at the age of 8. I have always enjoyed being able to build or repair something and see it work whether it was as simple as a screen saver or function to a more complex NLP model or a neural network. The time I have spent learning about machine learning and predictive analytics has made me excited to learn more. I am also really into Forex trading and the other financial markets and will eventually work to combine my knowledge of technical analysis with my coding skills to automate a portion of my trading. I am finding myself to be a capable leader and team member willing to help others whenever possible. I feel my extensive life experience in dealing with many types of personalities within many different social environments has helped to prepare me to integrate seamlessly into most professional cultures.
